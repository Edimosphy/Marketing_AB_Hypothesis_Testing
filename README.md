# Marketing_AB_Hypothesis_Testing

## 3mtt Module 5 Miniproject: Evaluating the Impact of Marketing Campaigns

## **Module 5 Objective** 
The primary objective of this case study is to perform hypothesis testing on the e-commerce dataset to compare different groups or features. Specifically, we aim to:
- Analyze the experimental and control groups to determine if the ads were successful.
- Estimate the potential revenue generated from the ads.
- Assess the statistical significance of the differences between the groups using A/B testing techniques.

## Define Business Objectives, Problems and Goals
### Obectives
- To determine whether ad campaigns are driving profitability and customer conversion.
- To use A/B hypothesis testing results to improve marketing effectiveness and revenue
- To identify optimal timing and volume of ad delivery for maximum customer engagement.
- To uncover user behaviour patterns that influence high-value conversions.

### Problems
- Low profitability despite running ad campaigns.
- Minimal market share gain due to ineffective audience targeting.
- High campaign costs with low conversion rates, leading to poor return on investment (ROI) and revenue
- Ads fail to attract high-paying, loyal customers, resulting in wasted marketing spend.

### Goals
- Achieve high profitability through optimized ad performance.
- Run successful and cost-effective campaigns that convert.
- Gain larger market share by targeting users more effectively.
- Attract and retain high-paying, active customers through data-informed strategies.

## Research Formulate Questions for Insights and EDA**
- What is the conversion rate in the ad group compared to the PSA/control group?
- Does a higher number of ads viewed increase the likelihood of conversion and profitability?
- On which day of the week are ads most seen, and does that impact conversion success?
- What is the peak hour for ad exposure, and how does it relate to purchase behavior?
- Are users who see many ads but donâ€™t convert showing any common patterns?
- Which ad exposure patterns (e.g., frequency, timing) lead to high-paying and returning customers?
- Is there a statistically significant difference in conversion success and ROI between the test groups?
